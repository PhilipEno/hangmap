# hangmap
A digital heritage / archive themed variation on hangman

## Background
This game is a variation on the HANGMAN game as found in chapters 7-9 of '[Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/)', by Al Sweigart. It was made as part of the Python learning path of the [Bits & Bots Studygroup](https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group).

## Requirements
* An internet connection is required in order to retrieve words from the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT).
* The `requests` module is used to collect data from the AAT. The module is not part the Python standard library, and has to be installed prior to running hangmap.py.
